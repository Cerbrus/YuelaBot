Cool to hear your guys' thoughts. After my third post yesterday I realized all of my posts were close to the character limit and was worried it might discourage people from posting.

I really agree that reflection and self-expression are extremely valuable, and it's not just an anecdotal or personal-opinion type of thing, either. I read a book a while back written by an FBI agent who specialized in negotiating with terrorists and kidnappers. He had many tactics for different situations, but one surprised me the most: he would tell the criminals what he assumed to be their worst fears.











It's sort of like this coastline. It's beautiful, but if you're surrounded by trees or further back in the woods, you might feel lost or frustrated or not even know it's there. Reflection and self-expression can help get you off the ground.
