      "com": "How are you doing, anon? Let&#039;s post walls that reflect our thoughts and feels. I&#039;ve always felt better when I got things out of my head. Maybe it&#039;ll help help you feel better too.<br><br>ITT I&#039;ll be posting a new wallpaper every day along with some of my thoughts on it. For the first day I&#039;ll share three. Feel free to disagree with any of the following. I appreciate different perspectives.<br><br>You can&#039;t look at a boat without thinking of a journey or an adventure. Like they say, boats were not built to stay at their docks. Clearly this ship is heading toward a harbor, nearing the end of its voyage, but is it arriving at a new land or returning to an old one? How long have they been out at sea? If this is &quot;home,&quot; how much has it changed? When I look at this wallpaper I&#039;ll have different answers every time, but I always think about the captain in the same way: he never expected to reach his destination.<br><br>I&#039;m in the same... boat. There was a friend I&#039;ve had for many years, and long story short I made it prohibitively difficult for him to continue to talk to me. It&#039;s not that he ever closed the door, it&#039;s just that the onus was on me to reopen it, which was extremely difficult because I have some pretty bad anxiety issues. The fall-out occurred a little over a year ago and I never went more than a week without thinking about reaching out to him again, what to say, where the conversations would go, and everything else, but I still couldn&#039;t get myself to do it.<br><br>Last week I finally put my foot down and promised myself I would finally reach out. I prepared more than I had ever prepared before, and I planned to do it today, but man plans and God laughs. I didn&#039;t reach out to him today. He actually reached out to me first, yesterday. It was unbelievable. After more than a year of silence, and the day before I resolved to reach out, he goes first. I&#039;m also surprised how easy it was for things to return to relative normalcy.<br><br>Also, my Captcha wants me to select images with boats. FFS.",

      "com": "Besides being comfy af, this one makes me think of the absurdity of the internet. I mean, if you have access to the internet, you have access to an effectively infinite source of knowledge. Even crazier, just a few decades ago, none of this stuff was easily accessible, if accessible at all. If you go back just a little bit to the 90&#039;s, they didn&#039;t have Wikipedia. They might&#039;ve had Google, I don&#039;t feel like checking, but inernet access was nowhere near as widespread as it is now. If someone today from a first-world country told you they don&#039;t have access to the internet, you&#039;d look at them like they were crazy, unless they were homeless. Actually you might still look at them like they&#039;re crazy but for a different reason.<br><br>Of course, it says more about people than the internet. With infinite knowledge easily accessible, people still overwhelmingly choose entertainment over information. It&#039;s not new, almost everyone by default gravitates toward short-term comfort and complacency.<br><br>Another example is exercise. Regular exercise is conclusively better for your health than a sedentary lifestyle, and it&#039;s been demonstrated over and over that you don&#039;t have to hit the gym all the time or run a mile every day. Even just some light exercise once or twice a week can have tremendous benefits, especially over the longterm.<br><br>I&#039;m not making any value judgments here, I&#039;m just saying it looks weird seeing people overwhelmingly and repeatedly opt for detrimental longterm outcomes, especially since it&#039;s not a matter of knowledge. Everyone knows they should exercise regularly, they simply choose not to.<br><br>Actually I changed my mind. It is retarded. Exercise more.",

      "com": "For anyone with really shitty monitors (or eyesight), there are two people sitting suspending from the colossal crane, like a swing set or a carnival ride. I can&#039;t even begin to imagine just how massive this thing would be in real life.<br><br>But it makes me reflect on how we live a lot of our lives on autopilot. Because if you lived in a world where these sorts of massive cranes existed, had existed for decades, and you saw one while walking to school or work every day, it&#039;d seem unremarkable. It&#039;s always been there since you were a kid, and since your parents were kids, and maybe even their parents too. It&#039;s not really a big deal.<br><br>For most people, virtually everything is unremarkable unless it&#039;s novel. This isn&#039;t unintended or even necessarily inherently bad, because if you&#039;ve done any reading into perception and awareness you&#039;ll know we actually actively perceive very little. You don&#039;t perceive each individual grain of sand on a beach or each blade of grass in the park because that&#039;d be inefficient and unnecessary.<br><br>However, I think a lot of people might feel a bit better if they slowed down to smell the roses. When you have a good chance, look up at the clouds or out toward the horizon. The weather is getting better, consider going for a walk. A long time ago I used to have some anxiety about going for walks, but the reality is people won&#039;t bother you and it&#039;s very refreshing to take a walk.<br><br>It really helped me appreciate my surrounding area more. Usually you pass all these things because you&#039;re going somewhere else, but when you&#039;re just walking you get to absorb a lot more and it really gives you a different perspective. It always sounded cliche to me to &quot;just slow down, take things in&quot; and it still does sound very cliche, but eventually I noticed I was unintentionally doing exactly that and also feeling a lot better as a result, so I encourage you to give it some thought as well.",

This photo of a cloudy, tranquil expanse takes on different meanings depending on whether you see the sun setting or rising, don&#039;t you think? Well, turns out if you don&#039;t know the time or where you&#039;re facing, you can&#039;t tell whether you&#039;re seeing a sunrise or sunset.

It&#039;s an interesting critical exercise to think about what they wanted to convey and the different ways they executed it, but I was always much more interested in what I myself could get out of any given work. The author can never predict all the different thoughts and emotions they&#039;re going to evoke. Personal interpretations are not only much more visceral because of the inherent personal connection but also significantly more interesting because they&#039;re emergent, unplanned by the work&#039;s creator.<br><br>On a side note, that&#039;s the reason why I don&#039;t like genius.com very much. It&#039;s cool to read about what the writer had in mind and it can help explain abstruse lines, but too much of the writing I&#039;ve seen on that site seems to lead readers to look at authorial intent as the sole legitimate interpretation and implicitly discouraging people from reflecting on what the music means to them.",

I\u2019ve had the vulnerable conversation of teling him that even after 3 years, and after his relationships with other women and his most recent one being abusive, I still harbor those feelings. He\u2019s still cool with me and he values my friendship, but he only wants to be friends.<br><br>But lately I\u2019ve wondered if my friendship with him and helping ME grow. At times I feel trapped with him; but like a comforting kind of trapped. Like, \u201csure, even if I may be stuck with you, it\u2019s totally okay with me because I love you. I accept this, even if it bothers me.\u201d It\u2019s like I\u2019ve lost all regard for myself when I\u2019m with him, out of love. He\u2019s currently at work and I\u2019m back at my place planning to go to the gym to reflect more, but last night when I slept over (in separate beds but in the same room), I stayed up in bed until 3am (he was out at midnight) alone with with my thoughts. Asking myself, why am I still doing this? Why do I keep coming back here? For what? He doesn\u2019t want me. I wanted him to be part of my life, but he doesn\u2019t want me to be part of his. Could we at least have sex? Cuddle? Maybe just have a heart-to-heart talk?<br><br>I\u2019m away from him now and it kinda hurts, but I know that constant perseverance at the gym and taking care of myself and meeting my goals takes precedence over him. And sometimes I\u2019ll even remember the times where he wasn\u2019t the best; and I know he remembers the times when I wasn\u2019t the best, either.<br><br>I love him, but.. y\u2019know. Maybe love can\u2019t stay. Maybe love shouldn\u2019t. I just want to feel at peace with my own goals; but dopamine from false love and friendships are tough to beat.",

It looks very peaceful, and the combination of quaint buildings, abundant greens, and massive mountains makes seem less like a location on Earth and more like the setting of a fairy tale.<br><br>But it&#039;s a very real place, and it really makes me wonder about what it&#039;s like to live there. In big cities, it feels like everyone&#039;s always in a hurry or stressed out about something. I konw the people living there have their problems too, but it just looks like an environment that has a kind of inherent soothing effect.<br><br>I wonder what they do for a living, too. I doubt a majority of the population there is retired. Are they mostly simple jobs like carpentry or baking, or do they commute to the bigger ciites? After all, Switzerland is relatively small, about 1\/10th the area of California.<br><br>Even though it looks picturesque and idyllic, I&#039;m sure some of them also wonder about what life is like in other places, too. I think it&#039;s just human nature to be intrigued by what we don&#039;t have. But there are a lot of things in my life I should be grateful for and I often take them for granted.

If you assert that elites are shape-shifting reptilians with magical powers, how could anyone disprove your claim? Those kinds of unfalsifiable conspiracy theories aren&#039;t useful.<br><br>But generally, people should be encouraged to ask questions. If you think some parts of a story don&#039;t make sense, you should feel free to ask questions about those parts without being afraid of people labeling you a conspiracy theorist. It&#039;s insanely hypocritical that the pursuit of knowledge and truths is admirable except for certain types of knowledge and truths.<br><br>The problem is that most people aren&#039;t trained in pursuing truth. People are conditioned to take so much information for granted. The first thing you should do when you encounter &quot;Why&quot;s such &quot;Why did a third tower fall on 9\/11?&quot; and &quot;Why did they all turn off their body cameras before they charged the room?&quot; is determine whether or not those things happened. Whenever you see a quote, you have to look at the transcript or listen to the audio yourself to determine whether or not the quote was taken out of context, or if it was even uttered at all. Outsouring these sorts of jobs to fact-checkers isn&#039;t good enough because even if everything they say is correct, you have no idea whether they omitted certain facts or not, giving you a misleading picture.<br><br>I mean, really think about it.<br><br>Ask yourself when&#039;s the last time you really looked into a particular event or story, comparing the differences in different outlets&#039; reports and digging through primary sources. When&#039;s the last time you read a statistic and actually looked it up to see if it was true?<br><br>People are bombarded with information all day.
